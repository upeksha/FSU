Social media moderation is notorious for inconsistent enforcement and wide reach on the basis of subjective terminology. Despite this, the proposed regulations envision complicated censorship of online content with firm enforcement. This will be likely to result in certain types of content being censored with a broad-brush. The proposals also envisage the use of AI technology in the moderation of user-generated content.

An example is the frequent use of the term “unalived” online to avoid filters targeting words such as “killed’ or “murdered”.
